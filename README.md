# Processing-Time-Prediction
The processing time and machine allocation are needed to execute the job shop scheduling algorithm.
However, it is volatile and unpredictable in the real-world manufacturing environment to get the processing time data. </br>
Hence, predicting the processing time is required. This approach uses DNN to predict the processing time.

## 1.1 Data Processing
In this project, the textile manufacturing's historical data from 2020/01/01 ~ 2020/12/31 was used. As it is the company's private data, I don't provide the data source but will explain the data processing processes.</br>
The processing time is in hours. The waiting time comes from (operating time - processing time).
